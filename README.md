# ROS2 PCD Publisher

This ROS2 package provides a node that reads a PCD (Point Cloud Data) file and publishes its contents as a PointCloud2 message on a ROS2 topic.


## Prerequisites

- ROS2 (tested on Humble, but should work on other distributions)
- PCL (Point Cloud Library) 1.12 or later
- C++14 or later

## Installation

1. Create a new directory in your ROS2 workspace's `src` folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/omerssid/pcd_publisher.git
   ```

2. Build the package:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select pcd_publisher
   ```

3. Source the setup file:

   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

Run the node:

```bash
ros2 run pcd_publisher pcd_publisher --ros-args -p pcd_file_path:=/path/to/pcd
```

The node will publish the point cloud data on the `/pointcloud` topic.
